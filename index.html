        The following recipes come from the different "Souths" of the world.
        <h3> MY TOP THREE</h3>

            <li><strong>Nashville Hot Chicken</strong></li>
            This recipe has swept through the Southern United States becoming one of the most popular dishes to try. Test your mettle with this <a href="hot-chicken.html">recipe</a>.
            <li><strong>Lamb Vindaloo</strong></li>
             This recipe is a traditonal South Indian recipe filled with flavor and enough spice to carry with you for days on end! Dont skip on <a href="vindaloo.html">this one</a>.
             <li><strong>Green Curry</strong></li>
             I learned to make this dish while traveling through Thailand. The fresher the chili pepper...the hotter the dish! Grab those peppers and <a href="green-curry.html">feel the heat</a>.
